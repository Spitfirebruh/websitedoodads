# The Purpose of this website?
**Tl;Dr: It's basically just to showcase projects I will make, am currently working on, and have already made and stuff.**

As I finally get into the programming space, I realize that the most important part of being a developer, is well one making good projects, 
but more importantly having a good portfolio that can showcase those projects.

There isn't much here as of 6/25/24 (creation date), but I'll do my best to continue adding on more and more projects and stuff onto here so you know,
I can learn a whole lot about programming and so that I can get a good job. :)
